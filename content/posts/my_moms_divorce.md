she gave her perspective
she did it for everyone involved
and tried for 5 years
she did it out of love
i had some naive hopeful dream or idea
of some outcome where our family stayed intact
i just wanted my family to be together
out of love
unconditional love
there was this really deep sadness that surfaced
as i was talking about it
there was also a stubborn self/ego/identity that felt a deep loss of agency back then at 6-7 years old
i actually am recalling the moment now i think
i remember being aware, upon my parents sharing the divorce, i felt a deep sorrow, said some words, went back to my room, and then this really clingy strong view formed
as a defense mechanism
in other words, an extremely strong ego formed around that despair and loss of identity & agency
the primary view of this ego was that “i didn’t get to choose whether my parents divorce and my family gets destroyed”
that’s the way i started to view the situation
loss of choice/will/identity/control
as a youngboy
thus, an extremely stubborn, extremely strong ego formed around it’s  parent’s divorce
mainly focused around the complaint that “i” didn’t get to choose the outcome or the experience
i had little to no choice about the event
and then, layers of anger, resentment, and hatred festered and formed over the years
i think that hatred is like twisted love
anyways
