she gave her perspective\
she did it for everyone involved\
and tried for 5 years\
she did it out of love\
i had some naive hopeful dream or idea\
of some outcome where our family stayed intact\
i just wanted my family to be together\
out of love\
unconditional love\
there was this really deep sadness that surfaced\
as i was talking about it\
there was also a stubborn self/ego/identity that felt a deep loss of agency back then at 6-7 years old\
i actually am recalling the moment now i think\
i remember being aware, upon my parents sharing the divorce, i felt a deep sorrow, said some words, went back to my room, and then this really clingy strong view formed\
as a defense mechanism\
in other words, an extremely strong ego formed around that despair and loss of identity & agency\
the primary view of this ego was that “i didn’t get to choose whether my parents divorce and my family gets destroyed”\
that’s the way i started to view the situation\
loss of choice/will/identity/control\
as a youngboy\
thus, an extremely stubborn, extremely strong ego formed around it’s  parent’s divorce\
mainly focused around the complaint that “i” didn’t get to choose the outcome or the experience\
i had little to no choice about the event\
and then, layers of anger, resentment, and hatred festered and formed over the years\
i think that hatred is like twisted love\
anyways\
