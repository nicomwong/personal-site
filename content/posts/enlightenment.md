## Knowledge

### The Four Noble Truths
- Suffering exists
- Suffering is rooted in attachment
- Suffering can be ended
- The Eightfold Noble Path is the path to the end of suffering

### Impermanence
All (fabricated or conditioned) "things" are impermanent.
(And,) all impermanent things are *dukkha* (suffering).

### Emptiness
There is no self-existing `thing` that can be found in any phenomena. Thus, phenomena are not-self (and, therefore,)
The "world" is empty of self-existence.

### Dependent Origination/Arising
Fabrication is dependent on Ignorance. \
Consciousness is dependent on Fabrication. \
Name & Form is dependent on Consciousness. \
The Six Sense Media are dependent on Name & Form. \
Feeling & Perception is dependent on the Six Sense Media. \
Craving is dependent on Feeling & Perception. \
Clinging is dependent on Craving. \
Becoming (anything) is dependent on Clinging. \
Death is dependent on Becoming. \
Rebirth is dependent on Death. \
Ignorance is dependent on Rebirth. \
And so on.
